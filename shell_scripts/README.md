The shell scripts will run through the scenarios on the Taqueria Docs website, such as QuickStart.
Run them and watch.

You have to copy the test files directory shell_scripts/taqueria-test-files
to your home directory, e.g. 
```bash
cp -r shell_scripts/taqueria-test-files ~/ 
```
so that the script can find them and copy them into a taq project

Scripts:
- taq-pre-release-quick-start-test.sh
